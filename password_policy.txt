Password Managers Studied:

Dashlane
LastPass
Lockwise
Password Boss
McAfee True Key

Password Manager I Chose:
I chose to use LastPass because it has a good free version that allows you to sync across devices and doesn't
limit the number of passwords you can save, unlike the free tier of services like Dashlane. It has 2FA and can
autogenerate a strong master password. LastPass also has a security dashboard that rates the strength 
of your passwords that I think would be useful to me.
